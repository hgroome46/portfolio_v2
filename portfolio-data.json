After conducting extensive user, product, and market research involving numerous interviews with universities and student athletes, I wire-framed and designed the UI/UX of a series of MVP's. I built the website and designed the app, backend software interface, and social media content. While Momentvm never saw the finish line, it was a great learning experience designing across brand and product. ",
